CALCULATOR BEHAVIOURS

- The calculator has a class for entries, and a class for the calculation chain
- When the calculator initialises, it initiates an entry class, with a value of zero. There is 
not yet a calculation chain

CONTROLS
C - Resets calculator
CE - Resets current entry to 0
⌫ - While in entry mode, deletes most recently entered value

OPERAND MODE
// DECIMAL POINT & ALL NUMERIC CHARACTERS
- All numeric characters and the decimal point are considered "operands"
- During it's initial phase, an entry is in "operand mode", where it will remain as long as 
only operands are pressed
- If the first button pressed is a:
    - Zero, then nothing happens
    - A 1-9 digit, then this overwrites the zero. From then on, any subsequent digits (including 
    zero) are concatenated to the end end of the entry value
    - A decimal point, then this concatenates to the zero. A decimal point differs from the other 
    operands in that it can only appear once within a given entry value
- Operand mode is reset if the entry is reset (goes back to zero - C/CE)
- Operand mode ends when either:
    - A modifier is pressed, it enters modifier mode (the entry is pushed to the calculation, but 
    is not yet closed, and is still editable by modifiers only - not operands)
    - An operator is pressed, it enters operator mode (the entry is closed and pushed to the 
    calculation, along with the new operator - the operator remains interchangeable until a new 
    entry is opened or the calculation is closed/completed)

MODIFIER MODE
// PERCENTAGE, RECIPROCAL, SQUARE, SQUARE-ROOT & TOGGLE-PARITY
- Modifiers "modify" the current entry
- Once a modifier is selected during an entry, operand mode is over, and the calculator enters 
modifier mode*

* The exceptions to this are:
    - if it is the first entry, percentage just resets the value to zero. It is then back in entry 
    mode
    - if the current entry value is zero, percentage does nothing (or, in effect, resets the entry 
    value to zero). It is then back in entry mode
    - if the current entry value is zero, reciprocal produces an error - "INVALID" - and ends the 
    calculation (cannot divide by zero). You will need to then reset to entry mode yourself, by 
    either entering some operands, or hitting reset/backspace/equals
        - Maybe have divide-zero error as it's own state? Or an error state? Same for overflow

- As modifier mode activates, the value as it stands is pushed to the calculation. But it is still
editable, only by valid modifiers
- Modifiers can "stack" for a given entry. If you add a square root to a value, you can then do the 
square root of the resulting value, or switch it to negative, or to a percentage, and so on
- The modifiers as they appear on the calculation panel are figurative representations of 
themselves. 
E.g. you type 4, then square-root it - on the entry pane, you see 2, on calculation pane, you see 
sqrt(4)
- If you do stack the modifiers, the figurative representation encapsulates the previous value**
Take the following example:
    - You enter 3, then square root it, then square it, the reciprocal it, then switch it's 
    polarity to negative
    - The entry display will first show 3, then 1.732..., then 3 again, then 0.333..., then -0.333...
    - Whereas the calculation pane will show:

        negate(1/(sqr(√(3)))) - where each symbol set "wraps" around the previous, at each step. 
        - This serves to demonstrate how the calculation pane is not a value store, merely a 
        representation
- CE will still reset the current entry to zero, negating any modifiers, if pressed during modifier mode

** The exception to this is again, percentage, which when used on a valid value (2nd or subsequent
entry) will "flatten" the representation to the current resulting value, in the calculation pane

Modifier behaviours:
    - Percentage divides the current entry value by 100 (converts it to it's percentage equivalent). 
    This only works as intended for the second entry onward (see asterisk clause below)
    - Reciprocal converts the number into a unit fraction i.e. 1 divided by the previous value (does 
    not work if value is zero, see asterisk clause)
    - Square exponentiates the value by order of 2
    - Square-root exponentiates the value by order of -1

- Modifier mode finishes when an operator (+/-/÷/x) is pressed, at which point we enter "operator" 
mode

OPERATOR MODE
// ADD, SUBTRACT, DIVIDE & MULTIPLY
- Once operator mode is active, the previous entry is pushed to the calculation pane, and is "locked
in"
- A new entry is initialised
- The final value of the previous entry is still present in the entry pane. This is the default
starting value of the new entry. If you press Equals, a modifier, or an operator, it will treat This
as the value of the second entry, and act accordingly
- However, if you start typing new operands, it will erase this default entry value, treating it the
same as the initial "zero value" when you start the first entry in a calculation. This becomes the
value of the new entry
- The operator that was pressed is the current one "staged" for calculation. It can be switched out
for a different one: they cannot "stack" like the modifiers. Only one operator between two entries
- The operator can only be switched out before the value of the new entry is manually altered, i.e.
when the aforementioned "cloned" value from the previous entry is still visible. This is how you
know you are still in "operator mode". Once you alter the entry, you are either back in entry mode,
or modifier mode, depending upon what you pressed
- Entering a subsequent operator (2nd or more in the calculation) after a new entry mode works the 
same as pressing equals - the result is pushed to both the entry pane (as the next default operand)
and to the calculation pane

EQUALS / EVALUATION
- Equals pushes the most recent entry to the calculation, and evaluates the result of the calculation
- It resets the calculator to entry mode, with the evaluated result of the calculation displayed in
the entry pane
- The previous calculation is wiped/reset. The previous calculation is still shown until you make any
further inputs, but it is not factored into any following calculation - the result is
- The entry behaves exactly the same as when you enter operator mode from here, as the
"cloned" value (the result) is now the default value for the next entry. Again, this can be
"picked up" by hitting an operator or modifier, or "dropped", by entering new operands
- From here, the calculator cycles through the behaviours as previously described

...and the world keeps turning, baby!
